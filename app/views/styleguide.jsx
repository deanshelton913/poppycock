        <h1>No, she'll probably make me do it.</h1>
        <p>No! The cat shelter's on to me. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</p>
        <p>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Bender, we're trying our best. <strong> Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that!</strong> <em> There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</em> Who are those horrible orange men?</p>
        <h2>When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</h2>
        <p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Ooh, name it after me!</li><li>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</li><li>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>It's toe-tappingly tragic!</h3>
        <p>I can explain. It's very valuable. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? You know, I was God once. Who am I making this out to?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What are their names?</li><li>Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</li><li>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! I never loved you. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</p>
        <p>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</p>
        <img src="http://placehold.it/350x150" alt="placeholder"/>
        <p>That's not soon enough! Belligerent and numerous. Guess again. Soon enough.</p>
        <p>Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</p>
        <p>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Moving along… No! The cat shelter's on to me. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
        <p>Negative, bossy meat creature! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. She also liked to shut up!</p>
        <p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
        <p>Say what? Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</p>
        <p>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. That's not soon enough! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Fatal.</p>
        <p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Also Zoidberg. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</p>
        <p>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
